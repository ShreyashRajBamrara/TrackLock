# TrackLock

A strategic, grid-based railway puzzle game where players navigate trains through multiple checkpoints using track levers and optimal routing.

## Project Overview

TrackLock is a Unity-based puzzle game that challenges players to efficiently navigate trains through complex track layouts. Players must strategically use levers to alter track states and find optimal paths to reach checkpoints.

## Core Features

- Grid-based movement system
- Dynamic pathfinding using BFS algorithm
- Interactive track and lever mechanics
- Multiple checkpoint objectives
- Strategic puzzle elements
- Time-based challenges (Coming Soon)
- Enemy train interactions (Coming Soon)

## Technical Implementation

- Built in Unity with C#
- GridManager for track state management
- Node-based pathfinding system
- Coordinate system for train movement
- Component-based architecture

## Development Team

- Nikita Sharma: Level Design
- Jessica Jasmine John: Grid Management & Node Properties
- Shreyash Raj Bamrara: Backend Development & Integration
- Kavyanjali Parmar: Pathfinding Logic & Additional Features
