# TrackLock System Architecture

## System Overview

TrackLock is built on a component-based architecture using Unity's framework. The system is designed around three core components: Grid Management, Pathfinding, and Node System.

## Core Components

### 1. GridManager
- Manages the game's grid system
- Handles track state changes
- Controls coordinate conversion
- Manages node creation and updates

### 2. Pathfinder
- Implements BFS algorithm
- Calculates optimal paths
- Handles path recalculation
- Manages train movement

### 3. Node System
- Represents individual grid cells
- Manages track states
- Handles lever interactions
- Stores pathfinding data

## System Flowchart

```
[Game Initialization]
        ↓
[GridManager] ←→ [Node System]
    ↓     ↓
[Pathfinder]  [Track States]
    ↓     ↓
[Train Movement] ←→ [Lever System]

```

## Data Flow

1. Grid Initialization
   - GridManager creates grid
   - Nodes are initialized
   - Track states are set

2. Path Calculation
   - Player input triggers pathfinding
   - BFS algorithm calculates path
   - Path is validated and stored

3. Track State Changes
   - Lever interactions update states
   - Path is recalculated
   - Train movement is updated

## Component Communication

```
GridManager ←→ Node System
     ↓           ↓
Pathfinder ←→ Track States
     ↓           ↓
Train Movement ←→ Lever System
```

## State Management

1. Track States
   - Normal track
   - Lever track
   - Blocked track
   - Path track

2. Node States
   - Explored
   - Unexplored
   - Blocked
   - Active

## Technical Implementation

### Grid System
- Dictionary<Vector2Int, Node> for grid representation
- Vector2Int for coordinate system
- Unity's Transform for world position

### Pathfinding
- Breadth-First Search algorithm
- Queue for node exploration
- Dictionary for reached nodes
- List for path storage

### Node Management
- Custom Node class
- State flags for track types
- Pathfinding data storage
- Connection tracking

## Performance Considerations

1. Pathfinding Optimization
   - Efficient node exploration
   - Path caching
   - State validation

2. Memory Management
   - Object pooling
   - Efficient data structures
   - State cleanup

## Future Enhancements

1. Additional Algorithms
   - Dijkstra's algorithm
   - A* pathfinding
   - Custom routing

2. Advanced Features
   - Time-based challenges
   - Enemy train mechanics
